# Jasper

This is a port of Ghost's default theme [Casper](https://github.com/tryghost/casper) for Jekyll based on the work of 
[Kasper](https://github.com/rosario/kasper). 

You might well ask at this point why bother making a new port (repo)? 
Although this is based on a fork of Kasper, there are some *exciting* additional features, making this port closer 
to the full Casper Ghost install. 

The main difference still is the fact that Jasper expects a single author. With a 
bit of tweeking it shouldn't be too difficult to enable a per-post author. 

Other less important bits that can still be 
addressed are the tag-descriptions and parsing 'Test Content' as a single tag, instead of as 'Test' and 'Content'. Feel
free to fork, and improve on this.
